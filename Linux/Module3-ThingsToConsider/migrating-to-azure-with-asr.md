In the demo, we used Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to migrate a Red Hat 6.7 VM from AWS to Azure.

ASR is mainly a disaster recovery product, but it's very easy to use it for migration scenarios as well.
Unfortunately, demoing ASR is not easy since you would need an AWS account or a vSphere Server.

You can use the [official ASR documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/site-recovery-overview/) to learn more about ASR.
